# todo-list

This web page is a todo list application. It allows you to create projects, each of which can then have their own todo's that you can mark as complete.

## Motivation

This project was made as an assingment for The Odin Project. It was intended to give me practice with using objects and the factory design pattern with JS.

## How to use
